## CPNT-262-Achievement #5: Stephan Taylor Looping Images

### Code Journal

#### Plan

1. Create a repo
2. Copy repo to root and add files then push
3. write code using starter help from Tony's in-class

#### Outcome

- Overall, I again had no idea how to make the images from the picsum appear on the html page. This required a lot of finess with the help of my brother.
- I mostly struggled with using `innerHTML`...I had no idea how to connect it to the declared variables.

  - I googled and youtubed a bunch of help with no success. I am finding it hard to find assistance as there are so many methods out there of going this sort of thing.

- After hours of struggling, I sought the help of my brother and he was able to point my in the right direction without giving me the direct answer.
  - He just commented on my page for the types of things I should be looking for and what I may google that might help.

#### Goals for Future Assignments

- I want to practice on my off time using `innerHTML` with the `output` while also connecting with the HTML...this is perplexing me, so maybe with practice this content will start clicking.
- Starting using APIs as well

  ### Attribution

  - To my brother Adrian Taylor. He helped me get an idea of what to do without giving me a clear answer.
